# Pivnich

I really loved working with Ada and previously Pascal, and in the future I will modify this project!.
Pivnich implements a simple end-to-end encryption algorithm using the XOR cipher technique.
Pivnich allows to input a plain text message, encrypt it, and then decrypt it back to the original message.
